# belly-button-challenge
This is the week 14 module assignment for the Columbia Bootcamp course.
This challenge proved to be the most difficult out of all the weeks thus far. On top of many aspects retrieved after research instead of through class material, I was also shocked by our lack of .forEach utilization. I think it's a phenomenal tool to better encapsulate conditions within a loop. For a while, I was struggling loading the plotly charts, but it turned to be due to an excess of an equal sign in line 34. Because the JSON files are a string, and my attempt to graph is numerical, I had to make sure the files can work with each other.
